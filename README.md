## Miscellaneous Problems
Miscellaneous problems are coding challenges that donâ€™t fit into common categories like arrays, strings, trees, or graphs. These problems often test your ability to think critically, simulate logic, perform bitwise operations, or design efficient systems. While they may involve common data structures, the main challenge lies in custom logic, optimization techniques, or unconventional approaches.
These problems are especially useful in real-world systems design, low-level programming, and technical interviews where you are expected to go beyond textbook solutions.

### Why Are Miscellaneous Problems Important?
- They help you get better at bit manipulation and math-based logic.
- They improve your problem-solving and logical thinking skills.
- They require combining multiple concepts, such as hash maps with linked lists or binary search with greedy strategies.
- They often appear in system design-oriented interviews.
